# The OSX Friendly Version of the Default Firmware

So, I took the default firmware and just made a couple of tweaks that make it easier to use with OS X:

1. The Cmd key is now on the right side, making Cmd+Space easier.
2. The media keys work on OSX (But not on Windows).

To enable key logging with Lead D, set
LEADER_ENABLE = yes
CONSOLE_ENABLE = yes
MOUSEKEY_ENABLE = no
(MOUSEKEY is only disabled to save space)
